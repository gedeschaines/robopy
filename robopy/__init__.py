"""
ROBOPY is a python implementation of The Robotics Toolbox (RTB) (The brainchild of Peter Corke)
for MATLAB. The toolbox provides a range of functions that are useful in the study and
simulation of classical arm-type robotics including kinematics, dynamics and trajectory
generation. Via the porting of the toolbox we hope to create greater access to the toolbox
without the need for pricy software subscriptions.
